Contributors: mikejolley
Requires at least: 4.1
Tested up to: 4.4
Stable tag: 1.4.1
License: GNU General Public License v3.0

Allow users to subscribe to job alerts for their searches. Once registered, users can access a 'My Alerts' page which you can create with the shortcode [job_alerts].

Job alerts can be setup based on searches (by keyword, location keyword, category) which are delivered by email either daily, weekly or fortnightly.

Usage instructions for this plugin can be found on the wiki: [https://github.com/mikejolley/WP-Job-Manager/wiki/Job-Alerts](https://github.com/mikejolley/WP-Job-Manager/wiki/Job-Alerts).

= Support Policy =

I will happily patch any confirmed bugs with this plugin, however, I will not offer support for:

1. Customisations of this plugin or any plugins it relies upon
2. Conflicts with "premium" themes from ThemeForest and similar marketplaces (due to bad practice and not being readily available to test)
3. CSS Styling (this is customisation work)

If you need help with customisation you will need to find and hire a developer capable of making the changes.
