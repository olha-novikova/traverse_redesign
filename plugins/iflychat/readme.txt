Integrate chat into your WordPress website. Allow users to discuss in public and private chat rooms. Skyrocket user engagement by 200%.

== Description ==

iFlyChat is a real time **chat** plugin best suited for **community** and **social networking websites**. It helps in increasing user engagement of your WordPress site by enabling users to **chat with each other privately** (one to one private conversation), **group chat** or in **chat rooms**. Also, it is useful for forums, blogs, dating sites etc. It can also be configured to provide **online support** for products/services. It logs the user conversations so that they can be later viewed using shortcode. You can try it out live [here](https://iflychat.com/installation/wordpress-chat-plugin?refid=wp).

**iFlyChat API Key**: Get your API key here - [https://iflychat.com/user/register](https://iflychat.com/user/register?refid=wp) (after installing chat plugin).
