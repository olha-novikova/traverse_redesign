This is a mini-plugin itself that adds the following functionality:
In the tab option it shows a list of custom post types, and checkboxes of all the existing user roles for each custom post type.
By checking a user role for a custom post type you are restricting admin access to that post type only to the checked user role.

VERY IMPORTANT: Always check the Administrator. Note we do not do it by default, thus maybe the Administrator changed the the administrator user role, so we don't really know what the administrator role is.

In the case of incorrectly setting the administrator user role, there is an option on the same tab to disable this feature an recover access to the custom post types.
